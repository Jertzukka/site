                This is a website for my personal projects, scripts and blog posts which 
                might turn out to be useful or interesting for someone. The posts will be mainly related 
                to my interests which are Linux and programming.

                    With the recent cases of DMCA problems over at Twitch I decided to download someone
                    clips over from channels and build a static website where one could easily view them.
                    I decided to go very barebones with just a shell script that reads video names and
                    creates HTML elements while scraping the relevant json files for data such as upload
                    date, views and such. This is the first time I'm making a website of this kind so I
                    decided to avoid any bloat frameworks and started from scratch.
                </p><p>
                    The content I uploaded at Azure Cloud with their blob storage service, which I managed
                    to get with $100 free credits for the Azure for Students campaign through my university
                    account. Not really sure how much data transfer I can actually support, but probably
                    not that much. I'll just leave the website up as long as I don't run out of bandwith
                    and it's still accessible.
