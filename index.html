                This is a website for my personal projects, scripts and blog posts which 
                might turn out to be useful or interesting for someone. The posts will be mainly related 
                to my interests which are Linux and programming.

                    Today I encountered weird slowness on my KDE, especially launching native
                    applications such as KWrite, Kate and whenever I would open windows such as
                    the native save dialog. For the programs they would start really slowly with
                    a spinning loading icon. When I would open save dialogs for example from the
                    browser the whole window would freeze for up to a minute until the save dialog
                    would finally pop up.
                </p><p>
                    I searched the internet for related bugs which mostly dated back to early 
                    2010's and I couldn't find anything very recent. However I came across some 
                    old posts which were battling with a similar issue with remote folders such 
                    as samba shares which were unavailable.<ref>[1]</ref> This would cause the save 
                    dialog to try to look up these unavailable remote drives and hang.
                </p><p>
                    What I didn't realize that I had actually changed my Microsoft account 
                    password which consequently changed my OneDrive password which is mounted 
                    on my filesystem. After updating my password on my rclone config, everything
                    started working buttery smooth again.
